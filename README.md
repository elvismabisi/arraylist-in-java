# ArrayLists Example
## Overview
The ArrayLists Example is a Java program that demonstrates the use of the ArrayList class from the java.util package. It stores marks of students in an ArrayList, displays the marks using both a for loop and an iterator, and sorts the marks in ascending order using the Collections.sort() method.

## Features
Storing Marks: The program stores marks of students in an ArrayList.

Displaying Marks: It displays the marks stored in the ArrayList using both a for loop and an iterator.

Sorting Marks: The program sorts the marks in ascending order using the Collections.sort() method.

## How to Use
### Compile the Code:

Ensure you have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
Use a Java compiler to compile the ArrayLists.java file.
Run the Program:

Execute the compiled Java program.
View Output:

The program will display the stored marks, iterate through them using both a for loop and an iterator, and finally display the sorted marks.
## Code Structure
The code consists of the following components:

storeMarks() Method: Stores marks of students in an ArrayList.

displayMarks() Method: Displays the stored marks using both a for loop and an iterator.

main() Method: Entry point of the program. It creates an instance of the ArrayLists class, stores marks, and displays them.
